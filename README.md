# Tools in Data Science (TDS)

This repository contains my work for the **Tools in Data Science (TDS)** course at **IIT Madras (Jan 2026)**.

The course focuses on **practical, tool-driven data science**, covering real-world workflows such as data sourcing, cleaning, analysis, visualization, APIs, automation, and deployment.

## 📌 Course Philosophy

- Learn by doing, not memorizing  
- Use industry-standard tools  
- Open-internet, problem-solving focused  
- Emphasis on *why* and *when* to use tools, not just *how*

This repository reflects that approach.
